# s7568_sboot_re
Some reverse engineering about the bootloader of GT-S7568
## Note:
This was done in 2019, just for fun and pleasure.  
I uploaded it here mainly as a backup, but anyone who is interested in can take a look.  
I can't remember clearly what IDA version I used was at that time, but 7.0 should work fine.
